    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This cinnamon roll icing will make any homemade cinnamon roll taste good! I tested many recipes for cinnamon rolls and found that having the right icing makes all the difference. Spread this decadent icing on warm cinnamon rolls of your choice and you won't be disappointed!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Butter and cream cheese: This decadent cinnamon roll icing starts with butter and cream cheese beaten together. </li>
        <li>Milk: Two tablespoons of milk help thin the cinnamon roll icing, creating the perfect spreadable texture. </li>
        <li>Vanilla: Vanilla extract takes the irresistible flavor up a notch. </li>
        <li>Confectioners’ sugar: Make sure you use confectioners’ (a.k.a. powdered) sugar instead of granulated sugar for the best consistency.</li>
        <li>Salt: A pinch of salt enhances the overall flavor, but it won’t make the sweet icing taste salty. </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Beat the butter and sugar together until creamy</li>
        <li>Blend in the milk and vanilla</li>
        <li>Then mix in the confectioners' sugar and salt until fluffy.  </li>
        <li>Frost the cinnamon rolls with about ¼ of the icing when they are still warm.</li>
        <li>When they’re cooled, top with remaining icing.</li>
    </ol>
