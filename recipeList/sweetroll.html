    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>There's no cinnamon here, just sweet rolls filled with homemade pineapple curd! You'll use about a cup of curd in the rolls, plus a little in the glaze. Serve remaining curd alongside the rolls, or use on toast.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Pineapple Curd:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ cups fresh pineapple chunks</li>
        <li>2 large egg yolks</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Dough:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup whole milk</li>
        <li>¼ cup pineapple juice</li>
        <li>2 ¼ teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon lemon zest</li>
        <li>2 ¾ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>½ cup whole wheat flour</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened</li>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Glaze:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup confectioners' sugar</li>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoons milk, or as needed</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt</li>
    </ul> 
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Make curd: Combine pineapple, egg yolks, sugar, lemon juice, cornstarch, and salt in a blender; blend until smooth. Pour into a medium saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium heat, whisking constantly. Cook and stir until curd thickens, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat and whisk in butter until fully incorporated. Transfer to a small bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and chill in the refrigerator until set, 2 to 3 hours. </li>
        <li>Make dough after curd has been chilling for 1 hour: Pour milk and pineapple juice into a microwave-safe glass measuring cup. Warm in the microwave for 30 seconds. Stir in yeast until dissolved. Let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes. </li>
        <li>Stir together beaten egg, sugar, and lemon zest into yeast mixture. Pour into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment, then add all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, and salt. Mix until dough comes together. Add butter gradually, with the mixer running, until fully incorporated into dough. Knead until dough leaves the sides of the bowl and looks smooth, 5 to 10 minutes. </li>
        <li>Lift dough out of the bowl and spray the bowl with cooking spray. Return dough to the bowl and turn to coat. Cover the bowl with a clean dish towel and let dough rise until almost doubled, about 1 hour. </li>
        <li>Place a baking sheet in the refrigerator. Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
        <li>Turn dough out onto a silicone baking mat and roll into a 12x15-inch rectangle. Slide the mat onto the cold baking sheet and return to the refrigerator for 15 minutes. This will make dough easier to roll and cut. </li>
        <li>Spread a thin layer of pineapple curd evenly over dough, leaving a 1/2-inch border on 3 sides. Roll up lengthwise starting from the edge closest to you. Use a sharp or serrated knife to cut the log into 12 even pieces. Arrange rolls in the prepared baking dish, spacing them out slightly. Cover loosely and let rise until doubled, about 1 hour. </li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) near the end of the second rise.</li>
        <li>Uncover rolls and bake in the preheated oven until light golden, about 25 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, make glaze: Stir together confectioners' sugar, milk, 1 tablespoon pineapple curd, lemon juice, and salt in a small bowl until smooth. Add more milk if glaze is too thick. </li>
        <li>Drizzle glaze over warm rolls. Serve remaining pineapple curd alongside rolls.</li>
    </ol>
