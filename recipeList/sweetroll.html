    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A sweet roll or sweet bun refers to any of a number of sweet, baked, yeast-leavened breakfast or dessert foods. They may contain spices, nuts, candied fruits, etc., and are often glazed or topped with icing.[1] Compared to regular bread dough, sweet roll dough generally has higher levels of sugar, fat, eggs, and yeast.[2] They are often round,[3] and are small enough to comprise a single serving.[4] These differ from pastries, which are made from a paste-like batter;[5] from cakes, which are typically unleavened or chemically leavened;[6] and from doughnuts, which are deep fried.[7]</p>
